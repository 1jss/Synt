<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Synt is a tool for composing synthetic music, in your browser. Its
design is basically that of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker">music tracker</a>,
which means that the music is organized in <em>tracks</em> and <em>patterns</em>.</p>


<h2 id="quickstart">Quick start</h2>
<p>The quickest way to get started is to press some keyboard buttons on the piano keyboard and then press the <img class="smallButton" src="gui/play.svg" alt="Play"> button to start the song.</p>

<p class="note">Note: The entire song has to be generated (i.e. synthesized in software)
before it can be played. This can take some time, but on a fast computer it should
not take more than ten seconds or so for normal song.</p>

<h2 id="theeditor">The editor</h2>

<p>A song is made up of <strong>8 channels</strong>, where each channel has its
own <strong>instrument</strong>. Each channel has <strong>36 note patterns</strong>
(0-9,A-Z), and each note pattern has <strong>4 note tracks</strong> and
<strong>1 FX track</strong>.</p>

<div class="centered"><img src="help/ui-overview.png" alt="Overview"></img></div>

<h3 id="theeditor_import">1. Import/Export &amp; Playback</h3>

<p>In this section you can import (open) and export (save) songs. Here you can
also play the song (or just a section of the song).</p>

<h3 id="theeditor_sequencer">2. Sequencer</h3>

<p>Each column in the sequencer represents one channel. Selecting a column will
show the instrument settings for the selected channel in the instrument
editor (4).</p>

<p>For each channel, there are 36 available note patterns. By typing a number
(0-9) or a letter (A-Z) in a sequencer cell (or by using the
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/go-up.svg" alt="+1">/<img class="smallButton" src="gui/go-down.svg" alt="-1">
buttons below the sequencer), the corresponding note pattern will be visible and
editable in the pattern editor (3). Holding shift while typing the character will
also advance the cursor to the next row. The cells can be navigated using the
arrow keys. Holding control down while navigating the table moves to the very
end (e.g. the top-most cell when pressing arrow up).</p>

<p>It is possible to select a range in the sequencer (by click+dragging), and
then copy the selected range with the <img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-copy.svg" alt="Copy"> button,
and the copied range can then be pasted to any other position with the
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-paste.svg" alt="Paste"> button.
A range can also be selected by holding shift down and navigating the table
with arrows. Alt-shift and arrows adjust the second corner of the selection range.</p>

<p>Hitting enter with a range selected fills the empty space in that range
by looping or interpolating the values at the top of the range. For example:
<ul>
<li>1,(empty),(empty),(empty),(empty) becomes 1,1,1,1,1.</li>
<li>1,2,(empty),(empty),(empty) becomes 1,2,3,4,5.</li>
<li>1,2,1,(empty),(empty) becomes 1,2,1,2,1.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="theeditor_patterneditor">3. Pattern editor</h3>

<p>The pattern editor consists of four columns, which enables four notes to be
played simultaneously. There is also an effect track (FX track), that can be
used to dynamically control all aspects of an instrument during playback.</p>

<h4>The note editor</h4>

<p>To enter notes in the pattern editor, <em>a valid pattern (0-9,A-Z) must have been
selected in the sequencer</em>. Notes are entered with the piano (5), the keyboard
or a MIDI input device (see below).</p>

<p>Just as with the sequencer, it is possible to select a range and copy and
paste note data with the <img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-copy.svg" alt="Copy"> &amp;
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-paste.svg" alt="Paste"> buttons.
It is also possible to transpose a selected range of notes with the
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/go-up.svg" alt="+1">,
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/go-down.svg" alt="-1">,
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/go-top.svg" alt="+12"> and
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/go-bottom.svg" alt="-12"> buttons.</p>

<p>Hitting enter with a range selected fills the empty space in that range
by looping the notes in the top part of that range.</p>

<h4>The FX editor</h4>

<p>To enter commands in the FX editor, select a row in the FX track, and modify
one of the instrument parameters. The corresponding command + value will be
entered into the selected row.</p>

<p><p>You can copy and paste FX commands with the
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-copy.svg" alt="Copy"> &amp;
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-paste.svg" alt="Paste"> buttons.</p>

<p class="note">Please note that FX commands are persistent, so if a command for a specific
instrument parameter is issued in one pattern, it will remain active until
set to something else (either in the same or another pattern).</p>

<p>Hitting enter with a range selected interpolates between the effect
parameters. The range has to be empty and the command in the beginning and
in the end of the same type.</p>

<h3 id="theeditor_instrumenteditor">4. Instrument editor</h3>

<p>An instrument is synthetically generated using a few simple building blocks,
according to the chart below:</p>

<div class="centered"><img src="help/instrument-graph.png" alt="Overview"></img></div>

<p>Each part of the instrument chain is controlled by the instrument settings,
and with careful tuning you can produce many different kinds of sounds.</p>

<p>An easy way to get started with an instrument is to select one of the presets from the drop-down box, and then change some settings until you get the sound you are looking for.</p>


<h3 id="theeditor_piano">5. Piano</h3>

<p>The piano is used for entering notes into the selected note pattern. Pressing keys on the piano will produce notes in the pattern.</p>

<div class="centered"><img src="gui/keyboard.svg" alt="Keyboard"></img></div>

<p>You can also press the corresponding keys on your physical keyboard to produce the same notes (as marked on the keyboard). The full mapping of the keyboard to piano keys are as follows:</p>

<img src="help/keyboard-layout.svg" alt="Keyboard layout"></img>

<p>The on screen piano and the keyboard only covers two octaves. To reach more octaves, use the <img class="smallButton" src="gui/go-previous.svg" alt="Octave down"> and <img class="smallButton" src="gui/go-next.svg" alt="Octave up"> keys to change the base octave for the piano and keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="playingmusic">Playing music</h2>

<p>A tip: Playing the entire song over and over when editing music can be quite
tiresome. Use the <img class="smallButton" src="gui/play-range.svg" alt="Play range"> button to just play the selected range (e.g. a single pattern). You can also use the keyboard short-cut: <strong>space</strong>.</p>


<h2 id="loadingandsaving">Loading and saving</h2>

<p>Songs can be saved as data URLs or as binary files.</p>

<p>You can deal with the data URLs in pretty much any way you want.
For instance, you can mail the song to a friend, bookmark it in your
browser, put it through an URL shortener and tweet it, or you can copy &amp;
paste it to a local text file if you wish to save it for later.</p>

<p class="note">Note: The entire song is stored in the URL. Nothing is stored in
a file or on a server.</p>

<p>The binary files, that are saved if you press the "Save binary" button
in the Save dialog, can later be loaded by drag'n'dropping them onto the
editor.</p>
